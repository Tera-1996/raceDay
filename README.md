# raceDay
A program for annual race, that will register runners and give them instructions for the race day!!
Check out the code on main.js

It startes with writing a boolean of true or false if the runner is early, and a variable that takes runner age.

Second, there are four control flow statements described below:

If the runner is registered early and above 18, the race will start at 9:00 am and the runner will receive a number above 1000

If the runner is registered late and above 18, the race will start at 11:00 am and the runner will receive a number below 1000

If the runner is below 18, the race will start at 12:00 am and the runner will receive a number below 1000

If the runner is exactly 18 years old, the runner should check the registration desk.
